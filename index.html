  <h1> Is Canes Football Back and Better? Early Review By Treasure Wilson </h1>

  <p> Canes Football hit a rough patch these last couple of years. We've had a lot of head coach swaps, with last year being Coach Manny Dias. Manny was eventually moved to Penn State, to be a defensive coordinator, which is  a downgrade to his career. Now we have Coach Mario Cristobal, and with the win over Bethune Cookman, people have high hopes. </p>

<p> Mario Cristobal was previously a coach at Oregon, and he's been eager to start his promotion as the University of Miami head coach. He has  alot of expectations for this season and he's ready to fufill them. It's not easy work, but having a potential 2023 NFL draft pick as your quarterback surely helps. </p>

<h3> Tyler Van Dyke and Backup Quarterbacks</h3>

<p> Tyler Van Dyke went from being a 3rd string Quarterback to QB1, after a rough start in the 2022 season. Deriq King got hurt early in the semester, and then so did QB Jake Garcia. This was Tyler's opportunity to save the day and he did exactly that. He was able to show his QB capabilities and proved he was  a great contender. Now he's the starting QB for the canes, and was able to win a lot of awards so far. There are two backup quarterbacks, that will soon takeover if they perform well, after Tyler graduates or declares for the draft. </p>
